# PintOS_MINT_VM
This repository is dedicated to configuring PINTOS on MINT VM. Furthermore, solutions to PINTOS projects will also be pushed.
I downloaded PINT OS files from: <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos.tar.gz">Here</a>. However, there were some PERL errors which caused trouble during building process. Also there were certain errors with new QEMU.</br>
Also, I followed instructions from several online resources. Have a look for more information:

  <li><a href="https://tssurya.wordpress.com/2014/08/16/installing-pintos-on-your-machine/">A Blog Post</a>
  <li><a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos_1.html#SEC1">Official PINTOS Page</a>
</ol>
Since these resources were either out-dated or hard to follow, I made a new instructions. 
## Setting Up VM.
Although Ubuntu is the go-to Linux distro, but here I went with Mint Cinammon. The solution should work fine on both distros.</br>
First, download and install VirtualBox from: <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">Here</a>.</br>
Once done, install the MINT VDI from oxboxes: <a href="https://www.osboxes.org/linux-mint/">Here</a>. Depending on your system, choose the appropriate file.</br>
Setup the VDI and boot MINT. Once done, you are good to start.
