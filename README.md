# PintOS_MINT_VM
This repository is dedicated to configuring PINTOS on MINT VM. Furthermore, solutions to PINTOS projects will also be pushed. 
## Setting Up VM.
Although Ubuntu is the go-to Linux distro, but here I went with Mint Cinammon. The solution should work fine on both distros.</br>
First, download and install VirtualBox from: <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">Here</a>.</br>
Once done, install the MINT VDI from oxboxes: <a href="https://www.osboxes.org/linux-mint/">Here</a>. Depending on your system, choose the appropriate file.</br>
Setup the VDI and boot MINT. Once done, you are good to start.
